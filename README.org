* Multigrid demo in 1D

This demo shows how iterative Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and Multigrid
solvers co0nverge in case of Poisson equation in 1D for a simple,
fixed source. It plots the development of solution at runtime using gnuplot.

** Build

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd build
make -f ../src/makefile
#+END_SRC

** Play

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
time ./test_1d 20 DD J | tee >(gnuplot --persist)
#+END_SRC

One can vary the size of the system, the boundary conditions and the
solver with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd command line argument,
respectively. Valid values for boundary conditions are ~DD~, ~NN~ and
~PP~, for Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic boundary conditions,
respectively. The solver can be ~J~, ~GS~, or ~MG~, for Jacobi,
Gauss-Seidel, or Multigrid W-cycle, respectively.
